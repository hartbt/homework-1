The assignment given came with a goal of redoing code that follow accessibility standards in order to optimize the site for search engines. Changing things such as tags and consolidating classes in the style.css will meet this goal.

This was completed by changing existing 'div' tags to tags with semantic meaning, such as 'header' or 'section'. Other tags added within the code are: 'nav', 'aside', and 'footer'.

This site was made more accessible for blind and deaf users by adding 'alt' tags to any existing images located in the code. 

In order to assist with optimization, the style.css file was reformatted and condensed by combining elements that could work in tandem. 

A descriptive title was added within the 'title' tags.

Comments were added to all changes noted within both HTML and CSS files.
