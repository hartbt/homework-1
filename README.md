The assignment given came with a goal of redoing code that follow accessibility standards in order to optimize the site for search engines.

This was completed by changing existing <div> tags to tags with semantic meaning, such as <header> or <section>. Other tags added within the code are: <nav>, <aside>, and <footer>.

This site was made more accessible for blind and deaf users by adding <alt> tags to any existing images located in the code. 

In order to assist with optimization, the style.css file was reformatted and condensed by combining elements that could work in tandem. 

A descriptive title was added within the <Title> tags.
